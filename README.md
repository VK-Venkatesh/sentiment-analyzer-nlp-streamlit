# Mental Health Sentiment Analysis ‚Äî NLP Project

### * Project: Sentiment Classification for Mental Health Discussions
### * Domain: Natural Language Processing (Text-Based)
### * Dataset Source: Kaggle ‚Äî Mental Health Sentiment Dataset
 (replace with your dataset link)

## üß†  Overview

This project focuses on analyzing text data related to mental health discussions to classify sentiment as Positive, Negative, or Neutral.
Using a CSV dataset from Kaggle, the project applies a Natural Language Processing (NLP) workflow to clean, preprocess, vectorize, and model the text using Deep Learning and traditional ML approaches.

The trained model is deployed through a Streamlit app for real-time sentiment prediction on custom text inputs.

## üßæ Dataset

* Source: Kaggle

* Format: CSV

* Columns Example:

**text	label**
‚ÄúI‚Äôm feeling very anxious today.‚Äù	 Anxiety
‚ÄúTherapy has really helped me stay calm.‚Äù	Stress

**Sentiment Classes:**

1.Normal
2.Depression
3.Suicidal
4.Anxiety
5.Stress
6.Bi-Polar
7.Personality Disorder

## ‚öôÔ∏è Steps & Workflow

* 1.Data Collection

* 2. Download dataset from Kaggle

* 3.Load .csv file into pandas DataFrame

* 4.Text Preprocessing

* 5.Lowercasing, punctuation removal, stopword removal

* 6.Tokenization & Lemmatization

* 7.Handling emojis/emoticons (optional)

* 8.Converting text to clean sentences for vectorization

* 9.Feature Extraction (Vectorization)

* 10.TF-IDF Vectorizer

Word2Vec or GloVe embeddings (for DL models)

Padding & sequence encoding for RNN/LSTM networks

Model Building

Traditional ML: Logistic Regression, SVM, RandomForest

Deep Learning (Preferred):

CNN + LSTM for sentence-level features

BiLSTM / GRU with Embedding layer

Transformers (BERT / DistilBERT fine-tuning optional)

Training & Validation

Split: 70% Train / 20% Validation / 10% Test

Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

Evaluation
